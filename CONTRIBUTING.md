# Contributing

## Getting started
Contributing to this project is welcomed and intended to be as straight forward as possible! This repo uses [Git flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow). To start, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/jas588/kasa-server/issues) with a brief description of what it is you would like to contribute.


## Branching
Please branch off of `develop` for a new feature or for a bug fix and off of `main` for a hotfix. Prepend a `feature/`, `bug/` or `hotfix/` to the branch name. The rest of the branch name follows kebab-case.

### Examples:
- `feature/new-thing`
- `hotfix/something-wrong`
- `bug/squash-it`
